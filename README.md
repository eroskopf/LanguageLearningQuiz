# LanguageLearningQuiz
An app created in Android Studio that administers a language learning quiz and keeps a high scoreboard. I completed this as a final project for a class I was taking with a partner. 

Implements:
- Firebase persistent memory
- Multiple activities that interact with each other
- Dialog popups
- Firebase login credentials

Created in Fall 2022 for an Android Software Development class
